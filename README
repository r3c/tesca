Tesca: Text Stream Calculator
=============================

Overview
--------

Tesca is a small utility intended to compute simple aggregations (sums,
averages, etc) on big (gigabytes or more) text files.

Text files should contain structured data, one row per line, and use a
supported format (currently CSV, JSON, and anything that can be matched
through regexps as soon as MinGW/GCC has a decent support for <regex> header).
Then you have to describe what kind of data contains each row and how result
must be computed from those data.

Example:

./tesca -i 'csv' -a 'name = $0, score = $1:sum, average_score = $1:avg' file.csv

No documentation yet, sorry!



Installation
------------

Currently only builds on Windows.

Grab a C++ compiler compatible with basic C++11 features (mainly lambda
expressions) such as GCC, update the Makefile.conf if needed and run make.
